Construct three distinct applications, each showcasing an increasing level of complexity and functionality:

- First, we'll Build a bot that mirrors your input to get a feel for the chat elements and how they work. We'll also introduce session state and how it can be used to store the chat history. This section will serve as a foundation for the rest of the tutorial.
- Next, you'll learn how to Build a simple chatbot GUI with streaming.
- Finally, we'll Build a ChatGPT-like app that leverages session state to remember conversational context, all within less than 50 lines of code.
